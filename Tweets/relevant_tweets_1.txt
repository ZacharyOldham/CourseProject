$aapl one of the strongest stocks last week during the sell off, but we did start too see some weakness towards the eod of the week. to see more downside its needs to not break and hold over 162.43 if it does can see 165-&gt;170 if we rejected 162.43 can go over lod friday 159

@asemota how can we provide more concrete measurements? to drive true adoption and actually achieve goals of sustainability, i think we'll need that.  for ex: many esg etfs today have stocks like $googl, and $aapl, which is a stretch imo. good returns for the etf, but defeats the purpose.
in 2020, tim cook earned $265,000,000 in total compensation, as the ceo of $aapl.   in 2021, warren buffett (berkshire hathaway) will earn ~$785,000,000 in dividends from $aapl.  invest.
@sawyermerritt yeah thats pretty funny. $aapl smartwatch sales are almost half of $tsla total annual sales. maybe its because $tsla doesnt have a chance or the tech to compete in wearables. but yet $tsla is a tech company i thought? theres little sustainable revenue in neural-net vaporware!
