imo $aapl's attempt to get into the ev market was a huge failure and unnecessary/a bad idea. they would've been 1000x more successful by developing a state of the art os for cars and licensing it to oems. this could've even worked as a saas alternative to the oem's os
@alex_avoigt $tsla still has plenty plenty of growth in front of it. farrrr from missed. $aapl 28xd in 2007, and it was $4

@themotleyfool this is a bit like picking a favorite child, but im going with $aapl. fortress balance sheet, massive buybacks, and a small divided to boot. they still have pricing power for their products and i think there is still plenty of innovation yet to come.
increasingly concerned that the big tech companies cant sustain their growth rates. their headwinds recently have been pandemic and stimulus related. $aapl are saying they have weak demand.  im not sure how the market and the market multiples will handle flat or negative growth.
@consigliereshs @sleepwellcap yes.   i think it is, for the most part, average. we def watch it and wont cancel. i think they are playing a different game from hbo, apple, and disney.   i have no position or real opinion as an investment.

@garyblack00 wishing a stock higher rarely works (although i will admit its worked a few times this last year). with $7 at best next 4qs, that would work out to 220x forward earnings or 10x the multiple of $aapl. keep smiling when you are wrong, cause youll need it!!
$aapl demand continues to slow. $tsla demand now growing at rate faster than apple when iphones launched in 2007. sell apple and buy $tsla. has worked for a year already.
@therealdarkpool where did you get the numbers from? $msft isn't down 11% nor $aapl! something is so off with this thing. https://t.co/lhhut54iaz

@proxima06_aiai this is why the $tsla correction is going to be so freakin' ugly because the uneducated are teaching the uneducated. it's 1/3 the market cap of apple, yet 1/17th the ebitda.  a split wont't fix the fact that $tsla is 7-10x more expensive than $aapl
$aapl next weeks puts  vs calls  options  might grab some 162.5 calls monday  https://t.co/ptk5rtpc9t
the $rklb neutron rocket 'launch' was awesome.  nice and short, to the point, great graphics/demos etc.   probably the most polished product launch i've ever seen.  (hopefully $aapl and $tsla took notes) https://t.co/twbsyzyp8j

@vera_icona_23 @meiyubense @richardmoglen relative strength is a key tenet in selecting stocks, and these custom studies aid in the process of identifying those stocks with relative strength. if the only criteria were "who is stronger". $aapl is the stronger in the short term, $msft is stronger in the long term.

(2) this chart shows 1 year of data. the middle chart - $msft is stronger overall (50% versus aapls 32%), but $aapl is showing greater recent strength.  the bottom chart shows bar-by-bar strength. when above zero $msft is stronger, when below zero $aapl is stronger. https://t.co/oeoez3ujgc

check out my #aapl analysis on @tradingview: https://t.co/v7akjivj00 $aapl fed exit, iphone sales slow down, bullshit apple car dream, hack in phones at state department, pure multiple expansion. it's the most vulnerable tech giant with a stock pumper out of pumps at the helm.
$tsla is to evs as $aapl is to phones. 95% of the people in the world can't afford them and will go with a cheaper brand any day of the week.
